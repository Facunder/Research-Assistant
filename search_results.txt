Title: ConceptMaster: Multi-Concept Video Customization on Diffusion Transformer Models Without Test-Time Tuning
Published: 2025-01-08 18:59:01+00:00
Summary: Text-to-video generation has made remarkable advancements through diffusion
models. However, Multi-Concept Video Customization (MCVC) remains a significant
challenge. We identify two key challenges in this task: 1) the identity
decoupling problem, where directly adopting existing customization methods
inevitably mix attributes when handling multiple concepts simultaneously, and
2) the scarcity of high-quality video-entity pairs, which is crucial for
training such a model that represents and decouples various concepts well. To
address these challenges, we introduce ConceptMaster, an innovative framework
that effectively tackles the critical issues of identity decoupling while
maintaining concept fidelity in customized videos. Specifically, we introduce a
novel strategy of learning decoupled multi-concept embeddings that are injected
into the diffusion models in a standalone manner, which effectively guarantees
the quality of customized videos with multiple identities, even for highly
similar visual concepts. To further overcome the scarcity of high-quality MCVC
data, we carefully establish a data construction pipeline, which enables
systematic collection of precise multi-concept video-entity data across diverse
concepts. A comprehensive benchmark is designed to validate the effectiveness
of our model from three critical dimensions: concept fidelity, identity
decoupling ability, and video generation quality across six different concept
composition scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ConceptMaster
significantly outperforms previous approaches for this task, paving the way for
generating personalized and semantically accurate videos across multiple
concepts.

Title: Comparative Analysis of Quantum and Classical Support Vector Classifiers for Software Bug Prediction: An Exploratory Study
Published: 2025-01-08 18:53:50+00:00
Summary: Purpose: Quantum computing promises to transform problem-solving across
various domains with rapid and practical solutions. Within Software Evolution
and Maintenance, Quantum Machine Learning (QML) remains mostly an underexplored
domain, particularly in addressing challenges such as detecting buggy software
commits from code repositories. Methods: In this study, we investigate the
practical application of Quantum Support Vector Classifiers (QSVC) for
detecting buggy software commits across 14 open-source software projects with
diverse dataset sizes encompassing 30,924 data instances. We compare the QML
algorithm PQSVC (Pegasos QSVC) and QSVC against the classical Support Vector
Classifier (SVC). Our technique addresses large datasets in QSVC algorithms by
dividing them into smaller subsets. We propose and evaluate an aggregation
method to combine predictions from these models to detect the entire test
dataset. We also introduce an incremental testing methodology to overcome the
difficulties of quantum feature mapping during the testing approach. Results:
The study shows the effectiveness of QSVC and PQSVC in detecting buggy software
commits. The aggregation technique successfully combines predictions from
smaller data subsets, enhancing the overall detection accuracy for the entire
test dataset. The incremental testing methodology effectively manages the
challenges associated with quantum feature mapping during the testing process.
Conclusion: We contribute to the advancement of QML algorithms in defect
prediction, unveiling the potential for further research in this domain. The
specific scenario of the Short-Term Activity Frame (STAF) highlights the early
detection of buggy software commits during the initial developmental phases of
software systems, particularly when dataset sizes remain insufficient to train
machine learning models.

Title: RadGPT: Constructing 3D Image-Text Tumor Datasets
Published: 2025-01-08 18:39:10+00:00
Summary: With over 85 million CT scans performed annually in the United States,
creating tumor-related reports is a challenging and time-consuming task for
radiologists. To address this need, we present RadGPT, an Anatomy-Aware
Vision-Language AI Agent for generating detailed reports from CT scans. RadGPT
first segments tumors, including benign cysts and malignant tumors, and their
surrounding anatomical structures, then transforms this information into both
structured reports and narrative reports. These reports provide tumor size,
shape, location, attenuation, volume, and interactions with surrounding blood
vessels and organs. Extensive evaluation on unseen hospitals shows that RadGPT
can produce accurate reports, with high sensitivity/specificity for small tumor
(<2 cm) detection: 80/73% for liver tumors, 92/78% for kidney tumors, and
77/77% for pancreatic tumors. For large tumors, sensitivity ranges from 89% to
97%. The results significantly surpass the state-of-the-art in abdominal CT
report generation.
  RadGPT generated reports for 17 public datasets. Through radiologist review
and refinement, we have ensured the reports' accuracy, and created the first
publicly available image-text 3D medical dataset, comprising over 1.8 million
text tokens and 2.7 million images from 9,262 CT scans, including 2,947 tumor
scans/reports of 8,562 tumor instances. Our reports can: (1) localize tumors in
eight liver sub-segments and three pancreatic sub-segments annotated per-voxel;
(2) determine pancreatic tumor stage (T1-T4) in 260 reports; and (3) present
individual analyses of multiple tumors--rare in human-made reports.
Importantly, 948 of the reports are for early-stage tumors.

Title: HyFusion: Enhanced Reception Field Transformer for Hyperspectral Image Fusion
Published: 2025-01-08 18:22:44+00:00
Summary: Hyperspectral image (HSI) fusion addresses the challenge of reconstructing
High-Resolution HSIs (HR-HSIs) from High-Resolution Multispectral images
(HR-MSIs) and Low-Resolution HSIs (LR-HSIs), a critical task given the high
costs and hardware limitations associated with acquiring high-quality HSIs.
While existing methods leverage spatial and spectral relationships, they often
suffer from limited receptive fields and insufficient feature utilization,
leading to suboptimal performance. Furthermore, the scarcity of high-quality
HSI data highlights the importance of efficient data utilization to maximize
reconstruction quality. To address these issues, we propose HyFusion, a novel
framework designed to enhance the receptive field and enable effective feature
map reusing, thereby maximizing data utilization. First, HR-MSI and LR-HSI
inputs are concatenated to form a quasi-fused draft, preserving complementary
spatial and spectral details. Next, the Enhanced Reception Field Block (ERFB)
is introduced, combining shifting-window attention and dense connections to
expand the receptive field, effectively capturing long-range dependencies and
reusing features to reduce information loss, thereby boosting data efficiency.
Finally, the Dual-Coupled Network (DCN) dynamically extracts high-frequency
spectral and spatial features from LR-HSI and HR-MSI, ensuring efficient
cross-domain fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyFusion achieves
state-of-the-art performance in HR-MSI/LR-HSI fusion, significantly improving
reconstruction quality while maintaining a compact model size and computational
efficiency. By integrating enhanced receptive fields and feature map reusing,
HyFusion provides a practical and effective solution for HSI fusion in
resource-constrained scenarios, setting a new benchmark in hyperspectral
imaging. Our code will be publicly available.

Title: Discrete Wavelet Transform-Based Capsule Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification
Published: 2025-01-08 17:49:52+00:00
Summary: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification is a crucial technique for remote
sensing to build large-scale earth monitoring systems. HSI contains much more
information than traditional visual images for identifying the categories of
land covers. One recent feasible solution for HSI is to leverage CapsNets for
capturing spectral-spatial information. However, these methods require high
computational requirements due to the full connection architecture between
stacked capsule layers. To solve this problem, a DWT-CapsNet is proposed to
identify partial but important connections in CapsNet for a effective and
efficient HSI classification. Specifically, we integrate a tailored attention
mechanism into a Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)-based downsampling layer,
alleviating the information loss problem of conventional downsampling operation
in feature extractors. Moreover, we propose a novel multi-scale routing
algorithm that prunes a large proportion of connections in CapsNet. A capsule
pyramid fusion mechanism is designed to aggregate the spectral-spatial
relationships in multiple levels of granularity, and then a self-attention
mechanism is further conducted in a partially and locally connected
architecture to emphasize the meaningful relationships. As shown in the
experimental results, our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while
keeping lower computational demand regarding running time, flops, and the
number of parameters, rendering it an appealing choice for practical
implementation in HSI classification.
