Title: Localizing AI: Evaluating Open-Weight Language Models for Languages of Baltic States
Published: 2025-01-07 17:24:17+00:00
Summary: Although large language models (LLMs) have transformed our expectations of
modern language technologies, concerns over data privacy often restrict the use
of commercially available LLMs hosted outside of EU jurisdictions. This limits
their application in governmental, defence, and other data-sensitive sectors.
In this work, we evaluate the extent to which locally deployable open-weight
LLMs support lesser-spoken languages such as Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian.
We examine various size and precision variants of the top-performing
multilingual open-weight models, Llama~3, Gemma~2, Phi, and NeMo, on machine
translation, multiple-choice question answering, and free-form text generation.
The results indicate that while certain models like Gemma~2 perform close to
the top commercially available models, many LLMs struggle with these languages.
Most surprisingly, however, we find that these models, while showing close to
state-of-the-art translation performance, are still prone to lexical
hallucinations with errors in at least 1 in 20 words for all open-weight
multilingual LLMs.

Title: Exotic elliptic surfaces without 1-handles
Published: 2025-01-07 16:51:34+00:00
Summary: In this article, we consider a sufficient condition that a knot surgery or
log-transformation of $E(n)$ admits a handle decomposition without 1-handles.
We show that if $K$ is a knot that the bridge number is $b(K)\le 9n$, then the
knot surgery $E(n)_K$ of an elliptic surface $E(n)$ admits a handle
decomposition without 1-handles. Furthermore, we also show that the double
log-transformation $E(n)_{2,q}$ admits a handle decomposition without 1-handles
for any positive integer $n$ and any odd integer $q$.

Title: Magic Mirror: ID-Preserved Video Generation in Video Diffusion Transformers
Published: 2025-01-07 16:48:31+00:00
Summary: We present Magic Mirror, a framework for generating identity-preserved videos
with cinematic-level quality and dynamic motion. While recent advances in video
diffusion models have shown impressive capabilities in text-to-video
generation, maintaining consistent identity while producing natural motion
remains challenging. Previous methods either require person-specific
fine-tuning or struggle to balance identity preservation with motion diversity.
Built upon Video Diffusion Transformers, our method introduces three key
components: (1) a dual-branch facial feature extractor that captures both
identity and structural features, (2) a lightweight cross-modal adapter with
Conditioned Adaptive Normalization for efficient identity integration, and (3)
a two-stage training strategy combining synthetic identity pairs with video
data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Magic Mirror effectively balances
identity consistency with natural motion, outperforming existing methods across
multiple metrics while requiring minimal parameters added. The code and model
will be made publicly available at:

Title: From Newswire to Nexus: Using text-based actor embeddings and transformer networks to forecast conflict dynamics
Published: 2025-01-07 16:45:37+00:00
Summary: This study advances the field of conflict forecasting by using text-based
actor embeddings with transformer models to predict dynamic changes in violent
conflict patterns at the actor level. More specifically, we combine newswire
texts with structured conflict event data and leverage recent advances in
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to forecast escalations and
de-escalations among conflicting actors, such as governments, militias,
separatist movements, and terrorists. This new approach accurately and promptly
captures the inherently volatile patterns of violent conflicts, which existing
methods have not been able to achieve. To create this framework, we began by
curating and annotating a vast international newswire corpus, leveraging
hand-labeled event data from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program. By using this
hybrid dataset, our models can incorporate the textual context of news sources
along with the precision and detail of structured event data. This combination
enables us to make both dynamic and granular predictions about conflict
developments. We validate our approach through rigorous back-testing against
historical events, demonstrating superior out-of-sample predictive power. We
find that our approach is quite effective in identifying and predicting phases
of conflict escalation and de-escalation, surpassing the capabilities of
traditional models. By focusing on actor interactions, our explicit goal is to
provide actionable insights to policymakers, humanitarian organizations, and
peacekeeping operations in order to enable targeted and effective intervention
strategies.

Title: Optimal Estimation of Temperature
Published: 2025-01-07 16:43:51+00:00
Summary: Over the past century, the Boltzmann entropy has been widely accepted as the
standard definition of entropy for an isolated system. However, it coexists
with controversial alternatives, such as the Gibbs entropy. These definitions,
including the Boltzmann entropy, exhibit certain inconsistencies, both
mathematically and thermodynamically. To address this challenge, we introduce
the estimation theory in statistical inference into the study of thermodynamics
and statistical physics for finite-sized systems. By regarding the finite-sized
system as a thermometer used to measure the temperature of the heat reservoir,
we show that optimal estimation of temperature yields the corresponding entropy
formula for an isolated system. In the single-sample case, optimal estimation
of inverse temperature (or temperature) corresponds to the Boltzmann entropy
(or Gibbs entropy). These different definitions of entropy, rather than being
contradictory, apply to optimal estimation of different parameters.
Furthermore, via the Laplace transform, we identify a complementarity between
estimation of temperature and system's energy, a concept suggested by Niels
Bohr. We also correct the energy-temperature uncertainty relation, as expressed
by the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound, in the large-$N$ limit. In the multiple-sample
case, we generalize the definitions of both Boltzmann entropy and Gibbs entropy
to achieve optimal estimation of temperature, revealing the tight connection
between statistical inference and Terrell Hill's nanothermodynamics.

Title: On generalized Mittag-Leffler-type functions of two variables
Published: 2025-01-07 16:32:36+00:00
Summary: We aim to study Mittag-Leffler type functions of two variables
${{D}_{1}}\left( x,y \right),...,{{D}_{5}}\left( x,y \right)$ by analogy with
the Appell hypergeometric functions of two variables. Moreover, we targeted
functions ${{E}_{1}}\left( x,y \right),$ $...,{{E}_{10}}\left( x,y \right)$ as
limiting cases of the functions ${{D}_{1}}\left( x,y \right),$
$...,{{D}_{5}}\left( x,y \right)$ and studied certain properties, as well.
Following Horn's method, we determine all possible cases of the convergence
region of the function ${{D}_{1}}\left( x,y \right).$ Further, for a
generalized hypergeometric function, ${{D}_{1}}\left( x,y \right)$ (two
variable Mittag-Leffler-type function) integral representations of the Euler
type have been proved. One-dimensional and two-dimensional Laplace transforms
of the function are also defined. We have constructed a system of partial
differential equations which is linked with the function ${{D}_{1}}\left( x,y
\right)$.

Title: Dolphin: Closed-loop Open-ended Auto-research through Thinking, Practice, and Feedback
Published: 2025-01-07 16:31:10+00:00
Summary: The scientific research paradigm is undergoing a profound transformation
owing to the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Recent works
demonstrate that various AI-assisted research methods can largely improve
research efficiency by improving data analysis, accelerating computation, and
fostering novel idea generation. To further move towards the ultimate goal
(i.e., automatic scientific research), in this paper, we propose Dolphin, the
first closed-loop open-ended auto-research framework to further build the
entire process of human scientific research. Dolphin can generate research
ideas, perform experiments, and get feedback from experimental results to
generate higher-quality ideas. More specifically, Dolphin first generates novel
ideas based on relevant papers which are ranked by the topic and task
attributes. Then, the codes are automatically generated and debugged with the
exception-traceback-guided local code structure. Finally, Dolphin automatically
analyzes the results of each idea and feeds the results back to the next round
of idea generation. Experiments are conducted on the benchmark datasets of
different topics and results show that Dolphin can generate novel ideas
continuously and complete the experiment in a loop. We highlight that Dolphin
can automatically propose methods that are comparable to the state-of-the-art
in some tasks such as 2D image classification and 3D point classification.

Title: Exploring the Potential of Large Language Models in Public Transportation: San Antonio Case Study
Published: 2025-01-07 16:18:55+00:00
Summary: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into public transit systems
presents a transformative opportunity to enhance urban mobility. This study
explores the potential of LLMs to revolutionize public transportation
management within the context of San Antonio's transit system. Leveraging the
capabilities of LLMs in natural language processing and data analysis, we
investigate their capabilities to optimize route planning, reduce wait times,
and provide personalized travel assistance. By utilizing the General Transit
Feed Specification (GTFS) and other relevant data, this research aims to
demonstrate how LLMs can potentially improve resource allocation, elevate
passenger satisfaction, and inform data-driven decision-making in transit
operations. A comparative analysis of different ChatGPT models was conducted to
assess their ability to understand transportation information, retrieve
relevant data, and provide comprehensive responses. Findings from this study
suggest that while LLMs hold immense promise for public transit, careful
engineering and fine-tuning are essential to realizing their full potential.
San Antonio serves as a case study to inform the development of LLM-powered
transit systems in other urban environments.
